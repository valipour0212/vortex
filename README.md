## installation

To install and use the Vortex framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/valipour0212/vortex.git
   cd vortex
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Ensure that Golang is installed (version 1.x or higher).  
   Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:  
   You can run the Vortex application using the following command:
   ```bash

   ```

## quick-start

To get started with Vortex, you need to create a new project. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Vortex Project**:  
   Inside the root directory of your workspace, create a new project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-vortex-project
   cd my-vortex-project
   ```

2. **راه‌اندازی ساختار پروژه**:
   از ابزار scaffolding Vortex برای ایجاد ساختار پیش‌فرض پروژه استفاده کنید:
   ```bash
   vortex init
   ```

3. **Start development**:
   Start by editing the main.go file or other module files based on your project needs. You can structure your
   application by organizing it into controllers, models, views, and routes.

4. **Build and run the application**:
   To start the server, run the following command:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## architecture

Vortex follows a modular architecture that allows you to easily integrate new components. The framework divides various
tasks into the following modules:

- **Core**: Manages routing, request processing, and core framework functionalities.
- **Database**: Easy integration with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- **Security**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms, including support for JWT.
- **API**: Creates RESTful APIs with built-in tools for request validation and response formatting.
- **Frontend**: Supports building dynamic and interactive user interfaces using modern JavaScript frameworks.
